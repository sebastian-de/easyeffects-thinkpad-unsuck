# Thinkpad P14s Gen 2 AMD Easy Effects preset

This [Easy Effects](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects) preset tries to improve the sound of the built-in speakers.

It was created by following the excellent guide [_Enhancing your internal notebook speakers without using an Equalizer_ by Markus Schmidt](https://jontes.page/misc-static/enhancing-notebook-speakers).

With some bass-heavy music this preset can lead to distortions. You'll have to reduce the _Amount_ of the _Bass Enhancer_ effect to avoid that.

The preset approprate for Easy Effects prior to version 7.0 can be found in the `easyeffects6` branch.
